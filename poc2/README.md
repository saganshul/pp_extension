# How to it works.
The smiling face represents that the page is safe, and danger sign to indicate that the page is potentially dangerous. The extension will also highlight the differences on the page if it crosses the threshold. If the page has 30% different compared to last time user was on it, the extension will consider this page hazard, and will mark the difference on the current page.


# Demo for testing.

You can use sample website provided in the folder called: tabnabbing-demo to test the working of the extension.
 - First load the page index.html and wait for a few seconds.
 - Move on to any tab, let's say google.com
 - The first page(index.html) in the backend changes to page /login.html which looks like github.com login page.
 - When you move to the original tab, the extension will mark the page as dangerous and highlight the changes on the page.
